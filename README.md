# SDP Benchmark Monitor

This repository contains the benchmark monitor that is used in conjunction with the [benchmark tests repository](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-benchmark-tests)

In the `bin` directory there are three executable scripts. `benchmon-hardware.py` and `benchmon-software.py` gather hardware- and software context respectively.
The third script, `benchmon-run.py` is used to measure runs of the benchmarks and is designed to be ran alongside the benchmarks.

This is currently a work in progress and work will continue during PI-23.
